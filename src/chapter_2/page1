● To check if the remote repository has any changes that our local repository does not have,
we can fetch
○ Fetch will bring the new data without added to our local project right away
● To update your local repository with the new changes from the remote we can pull
○ Pulling is more flexible. We will see later
■ Branch to branch
● Updating will apply changes to the same branch
.git folder.
